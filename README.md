# Netflix Data Analysis

## Project Summary
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix's movie and TV show dataset. I loaded and cleaned the data, created visualizations to explore trends like content over time, movies vs. TV shows, top genres, country distributions, and interesting patterns like ratings. The analysis answers questions about trends, dominant countries/genres, content growth, and surprises.

## Tools/Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (for the code environment)

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sola425/netflix-data-analysis.git`
2. Install required libraries: Open a terminal and run `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`
3. Open the notebook: Run `jupyter notebook` in the terminal, then open `netflix_analysis.ipynb` in your browser.
4. Run all cells: You'll need the `netflix_data.csv` file in the same folder (download it if not included).
